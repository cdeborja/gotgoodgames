# GotGoodGame

Are you a gamer? Do you consider yourself a <i>connoisseur</i> of video games?

Do you... got good game?

This is a github repository outlining the creation and implementation of
'gotgoodgame', a website akin to the currently running www.goodreads.com,
but instead will be more focused on video games instead of books. It is built
using Ruby on Rails and React js.
